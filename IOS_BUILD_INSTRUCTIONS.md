## 📱 How to Build & Run Your iOS App

### Step 1: Open Xcode
Xcode should have opened automatically. If not, run:
```bash
open ios/App/App.xcworkspace
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always open `App.xcworkspace`, NOT `App.xcodeproj`

### Step 2: Configure Signing
1. In Xcode, select the **App** target in the left sidebar
2. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
3. **Team:** Select your Apple Developer account
   - If you don't see your team, click "Add Account" and sign in
4. **Bundle Identifier:** `com.flpacademyworks.app`
   - You may need to change this to something unique like `com.yourname.flpacademyworks`

### Step 3: Fix CocoaPods (One-Time Setup)
Run these commands in Terminal:

```bash
cd ios/App
pod install
cd ../..
```

If you get an error about CocoaPods not installed, first install it:
```bash
# For newer Ruby versions (macOS 13+)
brew install cocoapods

# Then run pod install again
cd ios/App
pod install
cd ../..
```

### Step 4: Select Device
In Xcode toolbar at the top:
- Click the device dropdown (next to "App")
- Choose:
  - **iPhone 15 Pro** (or any simulator) for testing
  - **Your Physical iPhone** (connect via USB) for real device testing

### Step 5: Build & Run
Click the **Play button** (▶️) in Xcode toolbar, or press `Cmd + R`

Your app will build and launch on the selected device!

## 🧪 Testing Your App

### On Simulator (Free)
- No Apple Developer account needed
- Fast testing and debugging
- Limited features (no camera, Face ID works differently)

### On Physical iPhone (Recommended)
- Requires Apple Developer account ($99/year for App Store)
- Full feature testing
- Real performance testing

**To test on your iPhone:**
1. Connect iPhone via USB
2. Trust your Mac on iPhone when prompted
3. In Xcode, select your iPhone from device dropdown
4. Click Run (▶️)
5. First time: Go to iPhone Settings > General > VPN & Device Management > Trust developer
