# FLP AcademyWorks Mobile App Architecture Plan

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive architecture plan outlines the strategy to scale the FLP AcademyWorks trading education app from its current web-based prototype to native mobile applications capable of supporting 10,000+ active users on both App Store and Play Store.

## 1. Mobile Development Strategy

### Native vs Cross-Platform Decision
**Recommendation: React Native**
- Leverage existing web codebase and HTML/CSS/JS knowledge
- Single codebase for iOS and Android (80% code sharing)
- Access to native modules for trading-specific features
- Strong ecosystem for financial apps (react-native-keychain, react-native-biometrics)
- Faster time-to-market compared to dual native development

### Progressive Migration Path
1. **Phase 1**: Convert current web app to React Native using react-native-webview as bridge
2. **Phase 2**: Gradually replace WebView components with native React Native components
3. **Phase 3**: Implement native-only features (push notifications, biometric auth, background sync)

## 2. Scalable Backend Infrastructure

### Microservices Architecture
- **API Gateway**: Kong/AWS API Gateway for request routing and rate limiting
- **User Service**: Authentication, profiles, preferences
- **Trading Service**: Signals, market data, portfolio tracking
- **Education Service**: Courses, videos, content management
- **Notification Service**: Push notifications, in-app alerts
- **Analytics Service**: User behavior, trading performance metrics

### Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js/Fastify
- **Database**: 
  - Primary: PostgreSQL (user data, transactions)
  - Cache: Redis (sessions, real-time data)
  - Analytics: ClickHouse (time-series trading data)
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka for real-time events
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes on AWS EKS
- **CDN**: CloudFront for video content delivery

## 3. Database Architecture

### Data Models
```sql
-- Core user management
Users (id, email, phone, created_at, subscription_tier)
UserProfiles (user_id, display_name, avatar, trading_experience)
UserSessions (id, user_id, device_info, expires_at)

-- Trading data
TradingSignals (id, symbol, action, entry_price, stop_loss, take_profit, created_at)
UserPositions (id, user_id, signal_id, status, entry_time, exit_time)
MarketData (symbol, price, volume, timestamp)

-- Education content
Courses (id, title, description, level, video_url, duration)
UserProgress (user_id, course_id, completion_percentage, last_watched)
```

### Sharding Strategy
- **User Sharding**: Partition by user_id hash for horizontal scaling
- **Time-Series Sharding**: Partition trading data by date ranges
- **Read Replicas**: 3 read replicas per write master for query distribution

## 4. Real-Time Trading Signals System

### WebSocket Architecture
- **Connection Management**: Socket.io with Redis adapter for horizontal scaling
- **Market Data Feed**: Direct integration with trading APIs (Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud)
- **Signal Distribution**: Real-time broadcasting to subscribed users
- **Failover**: Multiple WebSocket servers with load balancing

### Data Pipeline
1. **Ingestion**: Kafka consumers process market data streams
2. **Analysis**: Signal generation algorithms (Python/TensorFlow)
3. **Distribution**: Kafka producers publish signals to user topics
4. **Delivery**: WebSocket servers broadcast to connected clients

## 5. Security Framework

### Multi-Layer Security
- **API Security**: JWT tokens with refresh mechanism, rate limiting
- **Data Encryption**: AES-256 for PII, TLS 1.3 for transport
- **Mobile Security**: Certificate pinning, obfuscation, root detection
- **Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA data protection, financial regulations

### Authentication Flow
1. **Biometric Auth**: Face ID/Touch ID for app unlock
2. **2FA**: SMS/TOTP for sensitive operations
3. **Device Binding**: Device fingerprinting for anomaly detection
4. **Session Management**: Secure token rotation every 15 minutes

## 6. App Store Optimization Strategy

### Technical Requirements
- **Performance**: < 3s app launch time, < 1s page transitions
- **Size**: < 50MB initial download, dynamic feature loading
- **Compatibility**: iOS 13+, Android 7+ (API level 24+)
- **Accessibility**: Full VoiceOver/TalkBack support

### Store Listing Optimization
- **Keywords**: "trading signals", "forex education", "mobile trading"
- **Screenshots**: Feature-focused with overlaid benefit text
- **App Preview Videos**: 30s demos showing key workflows
- **Ratings Strategy**: In-app review prompts after positive interactions

## 7. Scalability & Performance

### Infrastructure Scaling
- **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes HPA based on CPU/memory/custom metrics
- **Database**: Read replicas + connection pooling (PgBouncer)
- **Caching**: Multi-layer caching (CDN → Redis → Application)
- **Load Testing**: Regular tests simulating 15,000 concurrent users

### Performance Monitoring
- **APM**: New Relic/Datadog for application performance
- **Mobile**: Firebase Performance Monitoring
- **Real User Monitoring**: Track actual user experience metrics
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty integration for critical issues

## 8. User Acquisition & Retention

### Launch Strategy
1. **Soft Launch**: Limited release in 3 countries for feedback
2. **Influencer Partnerships**: Trading education YouTubers/TikTokers
3. **Referral Program**: $10 credit for successful referrals
4. **App Store Features**: Target "New Apps We Love" sections

### Retention Tactics
- **Push Notifications**: Personalized trading signals, educational reminders
- **Gamification**: Achievement badges, learning streaks, leaderboards
- **Premium Features**: Advanced signals, 1-on-1 mentoring, exclusive content
- **Community**: In-app chat, user-generated content, social features

## 9. Monetization Model

### Revenue Streams
1. **Freemium Subscription**: $19.99/month premium tier
